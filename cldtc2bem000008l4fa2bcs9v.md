# A short overview of Open Source

# This Is the Best Advice Given to Me

Getting started is often difficult, but it doesn't have to be. As a developer, you may quickly get the impression that repositories of popular open source projects seem out of reach. But don't worry, becoming part of an open source project is easier than you think.

Little is known that the projects rarely consist only of software developers. Designers, copywriters, marketing managers and various professionals are in hot demand everywhere. I was given the following advice from the FOSS community:

> Get involved if you have an itch to scratch. Have a project you care about and want to help make ‚better‘. There is no project no matter how big or small that cannot use an extra brain. **It’s as simple as that.**

# What Is Open Source?

Simply put, open source software means that the source code of the software is publicly accessible and can be used and changed by third parties. Projects are developed by volunteers, paid developers, or both groups (see Schrape, 2015, pp. 5-6). With open source projects, you have the opportunity to get involved with your talents in a wide range of welcoming projects and a pretty solid way to profit for your career.

Open source software (OSS) has become indispensable in our everyday digital lives. According to a study by the University of Bern, which surveyed 243 Swiss companies and public authorities, "despite its 20-year history, OSS is more relevant than ever". Nearly 60% of respondents said that the importance of OSS has increased, another third rated it as unchanged, and only 7% considered it to be declining. At the time of the study, the use of OSS had increased by 7.2% in the last three years (see University of Bern, Digital Sustainability Research Center, 2018, p. 7).

# Open Source Is a Major Part of What Gives Us Freedom

Open source is included in only two of the *"four freedoms*" of Free Open Source, or Free Libre Open Source, as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The Libre was added to avoid confusion with the English word "free" like in "no costs" (see Free Software Foundation, 2001). Both terms refer to essentially the same set of licenses and software, except that the two terms imply different core values. Richard Stallman explains:

> OSS development must also manage a geographically distributed team, requiring focus on coordination tasks
> 
> <cite>ABERDOUR, 2007, S. 58</cite>

# Open Source Is About Collaboration

According to Nakakoji et al., collaborative development is an essential feature of any OSS (cf. NAKAKOJI et al., p. 76). To participate every open source project needs version control. Web and desktop applications are most frequently used and likewise, a share of coordination is done with them. The best known are GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge.

In addition to simple version control, the platforms offer other features, such as complex repository and project management, social exchange, code reviews, pull requests or issue tracking. Each platform offers its advantages and disadvantages. In most cases, however, it is easy to decide which one to use based on personal needs and preferences.

# What’s Next for Me?

After this brief introduction, you just could go and start working on a project you got fond of. There's no barrier to doing so.

In the next post, you'll learn about the different types of open source projects that come in and get a quick, straightforward look at open source licenses.
